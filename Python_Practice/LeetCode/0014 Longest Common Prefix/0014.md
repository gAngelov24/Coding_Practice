### 0014 Longest Common Prefix: Python Solution

My solution takes the first string, and then continously cuts portions of that string off until we have reached the end of `strs` at which point we would have our prefix. My optimized solution relies on python slicing so the runtime gets a bit messy but in general we can say that in the worst case, we would have to iterate through all the charecters given. If we let n represent the total charecters in `strs` then the runtime would be O(n). Our space complexity according to LC is O(1).

Algorithm:
1. Initialize local variables: `prefix` (used to keep track of prefix), `curr` (current string), `prev` (previous string)
2. Iterate through `strs`. 
3. Set `curr` equal to the current string we are on.
4. Check if `curr` is empty, and set `n` to the min of `curr` and `prev`.
5. Slice `prefix` from `0` to `n`.
6. Iterate through `curr` and `prev` until `n`.
7. Once you find an index that `curr` and `prev` don't equal, slice `prefix` from `0` to that index and break out the for loop.
8. Check if `prefix` is empty, if it is `return prefix`.
9. Set `prev = curr`
10. Repeat steps 2-9 until you've iterated through `strs` completely.
11. `return prefix`
