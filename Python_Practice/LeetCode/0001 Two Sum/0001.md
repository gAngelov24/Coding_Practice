### LeetCode Question 0001: Two Sum Solution

My solution utilzes a dictionary/hash table which has an average search runtime of O(1). Becuase of this, the program has a worst runtime of O(n) where n is the size of `nums`. 

Algorithm:
1. Create a dictionary that will be used to keep track of already seen value index pairs
2. Fterate through `nums`
3. Calculate the necessary value we must have seen previously to achieve the desired `target` value
4. If we have seen the above value (`needed`) withing `seen` we can return the pair of indices.
5. If not we add `i` to `seen` at index `nums[i]`
6. Continue this process until proper indices have been found
