### 0026 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array: Python Solution

This solution has a runtime of O(n) where n is the size of `nums` and a space complexity of O(1) because we never allocate any additional data structures and only initialize local variable with space complexity of O(1).

Algorithm:
1. Initialize local variable `x` to keep track of the index of the last unique element found (start at 0 if `nums` is non-empty).
2. If `nums` is empty, return 0 immediately.
3. Iterate `i` from 1 to `len(nums) - 1`.
4. For each `nums[i]`, compare it with `nums[x]`.
5. If they are different, increment `x` by 1 and set `nums[x] = nums[i]` to place the next unique value at the next position.
6. If they are the same, continue the loop (skip duplicates).
7. After the loop finishes, `x` points to the last unique element's index.
8. The number of unique elements is `x + 1` — return that as the new length.
