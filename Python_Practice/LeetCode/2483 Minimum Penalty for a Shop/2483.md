### 2483 Minimum Penalty for a Shop: Python Solution

This solution runs in O(n) time where n is the length of the input string customers. It uses O(1) extra space because only a handful of local variables are used.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize `n = len(customers)` and two penalty-related variables: `penalty` (stores the best known penalty) and `pen_idx` (stores the hour to close that achieves penalty).
2. Compute the initial penalty for closing at hour 0 by counting all `'Y'` characters:
    - Iterate each character `c` in `customers` and increment `penalty` for every `c == 'Y'`.
3. Set a working penalty `pen = penalty`. This variable will track the penalty for closing after each hour as we sweep the string.
4. Iterate `i` from `0` to `n-1` and let `cur = customers[i]`:
    - If `cur == 'Y'`, closing after hour `i` removes one visiting customer, so decrement `pen` by 1.
    - If `cur == 'N'`, closing after hour `i` means you save the cost you would have paid by staying open, so increment `pen` by 1.
    - If the updated `pen` is strictly less than `penalty`, update `penalty = pen` and set `pen_idx = i + 1` (closing after hour i).
5. After the loop, `pen_idx` is the earliest hour that yields the minimum penalty; return `pen_idx`.

Notes:
- The algorithm performs a single forward pass after an initial count, keeping updates O(1) each step.
- `penalty` always holds the best (lowest) penalty seen so far; `pen` is the current penalty after considering closing at the current hour.
- Returning `i + 1` for `pen_idx` matches the problem definition where closing after hour `i` is represented by `i + 1`.
