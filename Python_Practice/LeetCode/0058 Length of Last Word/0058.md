### 0058 Length of Last Word: Python Solution

My solution has a worst runtime of *O(n)* where n is the length of the provided string `s`. It has a space complexity of O(n) because we store the size of each work in n sized array. 

I realize now that this solution can by optimized by starting our traversal at the end of `s` and only counting the size of the first word we encounter from the back. I will post this solution inside of the [C++ Solution](../../../C++_Practice/LeetCode/0058%20Length%20of%20Last%20Word/0058.md) for LC #58.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize local variables: `n` (size of input string), `maxCount` (array of size of words), `count` (counts the size of the current word)
2. Iterate through input `s`
3. Create local variable `cur` for readability
4. Check if `cur` is a space 
5. If it is then we check if `count` is greater than 0, that way we dont append the length of extra spaces.
6. If `count > 0`, then we append it to `maxCount` and set `count` back to zero
7. Else, we have landed on a valid charecter, increment `count`
8. Repeat 2-7 until you've reached the end of `s`
9. Return the last element in `maxCount` which represents the size of the last word.
