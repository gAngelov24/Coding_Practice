### 0013 Roman to Integer: Python Solution

This solution is slightly different from the C++ solution I made. In this one, I initialize a hashmap that stores charecter value pairs. This allows for easy O(1) lookup. Given an unknown charecter `c` we can easy check in O(1) time what value that charecter holds. This method does not significantly impact the runtime of space complexity of the solution.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize your dictionary with the correct Roman Letter Integer pairs. 
2. Initiatlize your `output` to 0 and a `prev` variable to keep track of the previuous Roman Numeral.
3. Iterate through `s` 
4. Each iteration store the current char inside a `curr` variable
5. Check if the value associated with `curr` is greater than the previous value added to `output`
6. If it is greater, we must subtract `prev` from `output` and add the difference of `curr` and `prev` to `output`
7. If not, `output += curr`
8. Continue iterating through `s`
9. Return `output`
