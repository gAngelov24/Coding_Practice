### 0344 Reverse String: Python Solution

The time complexity of my solution is O(n) where n is the size of `s`. My solution has a space complexity of O(1) as per the question requirment. 

Algorithm:
1. Initialize local variables: `n` (stores size of input), `idx` (stores index next char to be swapped), `temp` (temporary variable used for swapping chars)
2. Iterate through the list starting from the last index and moving backward toward the middle of the list. This ensures each character is swapped exactly once.
3. During each iteration:
- Store s[i] in temp
- Assign s[idx] to s[i]
- Assign temp to s[idx]
- Increment idx to move the front pointer forward
4. The loop stops once the middle of the list is reached, at which point the string has been fully reversed in place.
