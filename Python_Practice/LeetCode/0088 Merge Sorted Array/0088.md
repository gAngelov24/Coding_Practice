### 0088 Merge Sorted Array Solution Explination

In python we have the flixiblity to call all sorts of algorithms with ease. Hence for this question I didn't worry about where I inserted each element because I knew I was going to run the sort algorithm which would sort my array with an average runtime of O((m+n)*log(m+n)) where m is size of nums1 and n is the size of nums2. We can generalize this to O(klog(k)) where k = m + n. 

Algorithm:
1. Insert the elements of nums2 into the empty space of nums1
2. Call sort on nums1
