### 0027 Remove Element Solution Explination

My solution takes advantage of the fact that we can ignore any values within the array that match the target `val`. With my solution, the runtime you could encounter would be O(n) where n is the length of the array you are given. This is because we have one for loop that will always loop through n and make O(1) changes to the given array.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize current index tracker `k`. This is used to keep track of the index we are at.
2. Loop through `nums`.
3. Each iteration check if the current value at `nums[i]` is equal to `val`. 
4. If `nums[i] == val` then we skip that index and move on to the next element in `nums`
5. Else, if `nums[i] != val` then we insert that value at `nums[k]` and increment `k`. This ensures that when we return k, the first k elements in nums will NOT contain `val`.
6. Once we finish iterating through `nums`, return k.
