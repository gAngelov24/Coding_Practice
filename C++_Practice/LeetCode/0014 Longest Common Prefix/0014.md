### 0014 Longest Common Prefix: C++ Solution

This implementation begins with the first string as the candidate prefix and iteratively trims it to match each subsequent string. It modifies prefix in-place (C++ string is mutable), so no extra storage proportional to input size is required.

1. If `strs` is empty, return an empty string immediately.
2. Set `prefix = strs[0]`.
3. For each `i` from 1 to `strs.size() - 1`:
    - Let `curr = strs[i]`.
    - If `curr.size() < prefix.size()`, shorten prefix to `curr.size()` with `prefix = prefix.substr(0, curr.size())`.
    - Create an iterator `it = prefix.begin()` and compare characters of `prefix` and `curr` at matching indices:
        1. For `j` from 0 to `curr.size() - 1`, `if curr[j] != prefix[j]`:
            - Erase the remainder of prefix from the mismatch position by `prefix.erase(it, prefix.end())`.
            - Break out of the inner loop (prefix is now the common part with curr).
        2. Advance it as you compare characters.
4. After processing all strings, prefix contains the longest common prefix; return it.
