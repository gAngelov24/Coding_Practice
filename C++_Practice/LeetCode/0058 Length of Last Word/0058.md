### 0058 Length of Last Word: C++ Solution

This is the optimized solution for LC #58. This solution has a worst runtime of O(n), and a space complexity of O(1). 

When we look at simply worst runtime, both this C++ solution and the [Python Solution](../../../Python_Practice/LeetCode/0058%20Length%20of%20Last%20Word/0058.md) are no different. However, imagine if we were given a book and wanted to find the length of the last word. My Python solution would find the length of every single word in the book and add it to an array. While this works, and we do get the length of the last word, it is not optimal for this question. This C++ solution elimates that issue by starting the traversal at the end of the book, making sure to only count the size of the last word.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize local variables: `n` (size of input string `s`), `count` (keeps track of length of last word).
2. Iterate through `s` starting from the back.
3. Check if our current charecter is a space & that our count is greater than zero. This is how we know that the last word has ended.
4. If we have traversed through the last word, `return count`.
5. If our current char does not equal a space then we increment count. This makes sure we dont end our loop prematurely in the case a trailing spaces.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until `count` is returned or we reach the beginning of `s`.
7. Return `count`
