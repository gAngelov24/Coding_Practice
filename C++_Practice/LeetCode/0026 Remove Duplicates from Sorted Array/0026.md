### 0026 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array: Python Solution

This solution has a runtime of O(n) where n is the size of `nums` and a space complexity of O(1) because we never allocate any additional data structures and only initialize local variable with space complexity of O(1).

Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty `unordered_map<int,int> seen` to track seen values (and their last index).
2. Initialize `k = 0` to mark the position to write the next unique value.
3. Loop `i` from 0 to `nums.size() - 1`.
4. If `nums[i]` is not in `seen`, set `nums[k] = nums[i]` and increment `k`.
5. Record/update `seen[nums[i]] = i`.
6. After the loop, `k` is the number of unique elements — `return k`.
