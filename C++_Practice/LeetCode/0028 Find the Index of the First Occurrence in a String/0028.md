### 0028 Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String: C++ Solution

This solution is NOT optimized. The solution has a worst runtime of O(n<sup>2</sup>). This is because the total runtime is O(n) from the main for loop and O(len) from the `substr` method. Therefore we have O(n) * O(len) = O(n * len), if `n == len` then we have O(n * n) = O(n<sup>2</sup>). Our space complexity is O(1). 

Algorithm:
1. Initialize local variable: `n` (size of `haystack`), `len` (size of `needle`)
2. Iterate through `haystack` untile you reach the `n-len` position. At this point any substring would be too short to be equal to `needle`.
    - Create new substring, `sub = haystack.substr(i, len)`
    - Check if `sub == needle`
    - If it equals, `return i`
    - Else, continue iterating
3. If exited the for loop then there were no substring that equaled `needle`, `return -1`
