### 2483 Minimum Penalty for a Shop: C++ Solution

My solution has a runtime of O(n) where n is the length of the input string `customers`. It has a space complexity of O(1) as it only stores a few local variables and a vector of constant length of 2.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize local variables: `n` (size of input vector), `count` (stores penalty), `ret` (stores penalty in index 1 and the jth hour you should close at in index 0).
2. Iterate through `customers`.
    - create variable `pen` that hold the penalty of that hour.
    - add that penalty to count: `count += pen`.
3. Now that you have the penalty at the 0th hour, initialize your ret vector: `ret = [0, count]`.
4. Iterate through `customers` once more.
    - track the change in the penalty: `change = (customers[i] == 'Y') ? -1:1`. If you close the store when there are customers, you lost profit (-1), otherwise, you save money (+1).
    - add this `change` to `count`.
    - check if the new penalty is less than before: `count < ret[1]`
    - If the new `count` is less than `ret[1]`, update the `ret` values
    - Else, `continue`
5. Once done, you final answer is stored inside ret[0]: `return ret[0]`
